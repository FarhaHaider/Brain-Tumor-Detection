This repo consists of codebase to detect Brain Tumour from MRI scans. 
Principal Component Analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of flattened images and still achieve good accuracy.

The Data was obtained from Kaggle - src: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhranta/brain-tumor-detection-mri. 
The dataset consists of 3000 MR scans â€“ 1500 images with tumor and 1500 non-tumor images.
